# Malware-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Malware Detection with help of Image processing

In this Project we can predict if any incoming file is malacious or safe.
We use image processing technique to create our dataset and train our model.

Steps to setup and use this Software:

1. Run BenignGenerator.py to collect all the benign files from your system.
